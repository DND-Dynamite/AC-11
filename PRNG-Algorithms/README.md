# Classification of Random Number Generations in General

- random number/string generator
- pseudo random number/string generator
- cryptographically safe random number/string generator

## random number/string generator

- A truly random number generator (TRNG), also known as a hardware random number generator (HRNG) or physical random number generator, produces numbers from an unpredictable physical source, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay, rather than a deterministic algorithm. You can find one by using a hardware device that captures a physical phenomenon and converts its entropy into a random number

### what is entropy

- Entropy is a scientific concept that measures disorder, randomness, or uncertainty within a system, essentially quantifying how dispersed energy and particles are, a key component of second law of thermodynamics

### how TRNGs Work

- Physical Entropy: They extract randomness from unpredictable physical events like atmospheric static, thermal noise in electrical circuits, or subatomic particle behavior. 
- Hardware Implementation: These physical sources are measured by specialized hardware devices. 
- Processing: The captured physical data is then processed through a function to produce a sequence of random numbers. 
- Unpredictability: Because the input is a physical phenomenon, the output sequence is practically impossible to predict, making it suitable for security-sensitive applications.

### how to Find One

- Hardware Modules: Many modern computers and security devices include hardware components that function as TRNGs. 
- Operating System Interfaces: Operating systems often provide interfaces for accessing hardware randomness. For example, on Linux systems, you can access the /dev/hwrng device to get entropy. 
- Cloud Services: Some cloud providers and services may offer access to true random number generation services, allowing developers to generate seeds for their applications or use truly random numbers directly. 
- Real-World Examples: While less common in everyday programming, some applications use physical phenomena like the movement of lava lamps (captured by a camera) or precise timing of disk operations to generate entropy.

## pseudo random numbers

- Pseudo-random numbers are a sequence of numbers generated by a deterministic algorithm that appears random but is entirely predictable if the initial seed and the algorithm are known.
- Unlike truly random numbers, which are derived from unpredictable physical processes, pseudo-random numbers are produced by mathematical formulas


### Key Characteristics
- Deterministic: Their generation is based on a mathematical algorithm, meaning the sequence is entirely determined by the initial seed. 
Appears Random: The numbers generated exhibit many properties of random numbers, such as appearing unpredictable and having a uniform distribution, but they are not truly random. 
- Reproducible: Given the same starting "seed" (an initial value that kicks off the sequence), a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) will always produce the exact same sequence of numbers. 
- Long Cycle: A good PRNG will have a very long cycle, meaning it generates a vast number of unique numbers before the sequence repeats. 
- Fast Generation: PRNGs are designed to generate numbers quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for many computational applications. 

### How They Are Generated 
- Seed: The process begins with a "seed," which is an initial number or value that starts the sequence. This could be the time of day, or a user-defined number.
- Algorithm: A mathematical algorithm (the PRNG) uses this seed to calculate the first pseudo-random number.
- Next Number: Each subsequent number in the sequence is generated based on the previous number, following the strict rules of the algorithm.


# Best Practices for Random Number Generation in python

## Code Overview
This Python program generates a cryptographically secure random alphanumeric string of specified length.

## Purpose
- Generates a secure random string containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits
- Length is determined by the input parameter

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **Import**
```python
import secrets
```
- Uses Python's `secrets` module (available in Python 3.6+)
- **Key advantage**: Designed for cryptographic security, better than `random` module

### 2. **Function Definition**
```python
def generate_alphanumeric_string(length):
```
- Clean function signature with parameter for custom length

### 3. **Character Set**
```python
characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
```
- 62 possible characters (26 uppercase + 26 lowercase + 10 digits)
- Comprehensive alphanumeric selection

### 4. **Random String Generation**
```python
random_string = ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
```
- **`secrets.choice()`**: Cryptographically secure random selection
- **Generator expression**: Memory-efficient for large strings
- **`''.join()`**: Efficient string building

### 5. **Usage**
```python
print(generate_alphanumeric_string(16))
```
- Generates and prints a 16-character secure random string

## Strengths

### **Security:**
- Uses `secrets` module instead of `random`
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Suitable for passwords, tokens, and security-sensitive applications

### **Code Quality:**
- Clean, readable, and concise
- Proper function encapsulation
- Efficient string construction
- Clear variable naming

### **Flexibility:**
- Customizable length parameter
- Easy to modify character set

## ðŸ”§ Potential Use Cases
- API keys and tokens
- Password generation
- Unique identifiers
- Session tokens
- Cryptographic nonces

## Performance Note
The code is efficient for most practical purposes, but for generating very long strings (thousands of characters), using `secrets.token_urlsafe()` or similar might be more efficient.

# Best Practices for Random Number Generation in C++

- Given all alphabets in a character array, print a string of random characters of given size.
- We will use rand() function to print random characters. It returns random integer values. This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers each time it is called.

- A ubiquitous use of unpredictable random characters is in cryptography, which underlies most of the schemes which attempt to provide security in modern communications (e.g. confidentiality, authentication, electronic commerce, etc).
- Random numbers are also used in situations where "fairness" is approximated by randomization, such as selecting jurors and military draft lotteries.
- Random numbers have uses in physics such as electronic noise studies, engineering, and operations research. Many methods of statistical analysis, such as the bootstrap method, require random numbers.

## Pseudo Code

1. First we initialize two character arrays, one containing all the alphabets and other of given size n to store result.
2. Then we initialize the seed to current system time so that every time a new random seed is generated.
3. seed helps to re-generate the random number, i.e as long as we knew the seed
4. here, srand() function is used to genearte the random string
5. timestamp is passed as string
6. Next, we use for loop till n and store random generated alphabets.
