# Best Practices for Random Number Generation in python

- Uses Python's secrets module (available in Python 3.6+)

- Key advantage: Designed for cryptographic security, better than random module

- 62 possible characters (26 uppercase + 26 lowercase + 10 digits)

- Comprehensive alphanumeric selection




# Best Practices for Random Number Generation in C++

- Given all alphabets in a character array, print a string of random characters of given size.
- We will use rand() function to print random characters. It returns random integer values. This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers each time it is called.

- A ubiquitous use of unpredictable random characters is in cryptography, which underlies most of the schemes which attempt to provide security in modern communications (e.g. confidentiality, authentication, electronic commerce, etc).
- Random numbers are also used in situations where "fairness" is approximated by randomization, such as selecting jurors and military draft lotteries.
- Random numbers have uses in physics such as electronic noise studies, engineering, and operations research. Many methods of statistical analysis, such as the bootstrap method, require random numbers.

## Pseudo Code


1. First we initialize two character arrays, one containing all the alphabets and other of given size n to store result.
2. Then we initialize the seed to current system time so that every time a new random seed is generated.
3. Next, we use for loop till n and store random generated alphabets.
